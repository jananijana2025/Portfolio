        My Story
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
        I'm a graduate student, specializing in investigative journlism at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Chicago.
        I was born and raised in Bangalore in southern India, and have a strong affinity to my Indian roots. I'm interested in topics of financial policy, domestic taxation and bileateral relations, relevant to the Global South and Southeast Asia.
        My previous experiences include positions in broadcast, radio and magazine and digital writing, with my last job at NDTV Profit, a business news channel in New Delhi. 
        I am currently externing with the investigations team at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and hope to work at the intersection of data and insight-driven narratives on financial topics.
        In my spare time, I love to go on guided historical tours, sample varied vegetarian foods and cater to my enormous sweet tooth.
