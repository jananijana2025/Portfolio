                    I was born and raised in southern India before work took me around the country. I stayed in New Delhi during my early career years where I reported 
                    on finance and trade policy. After that I moved to Chicago for a master's degree in investigative journalism at Northwestern University's Medill School 
                    of Journalism. Since then I've relocated to write on land-use, economic development and commericial real estate in Northern Virginia, as a staff 
                    reporter at the Washington Business Journal. My interest in public records and investigative narratives inform my passion for business stories, 
                    but doesn't limit me to it. I've previously written for the Chicago Sun-Times, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Mindsite News, NDTV Profit 
                    and BW Businessworld.

                    My career experiences range across digital, broadcast, print and radio, making my flexibility and adaptability my biggest strength. 
                    I'm a sum of all the cities I've been in, and I firmly believe that a nose for newsworthiness and the persistence that goes with it are 
                    transferable skills across continents.
