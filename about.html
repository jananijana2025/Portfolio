                    Janani is a graduate student with a specialization in data-focused investigative journalism from Northwestern University's 
                    Medill School of Journalism in Chicago. She was born and raised in Bangalore, in southern India. She is interested in business-focused narrative journalism and 
                    longform investigations but does not want to limit herself to it. She is currently working with the city desk at Chicago Sun-Times for her Master's internship 
                    and also worked with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's investigations team. 
                    </h2>

                    <h2>Prior to her roles in Chicago, she was the New Delhi correspondent for an Indian broadcast channel, juggling video and web priorities as a financial policy jounralist. 
                        Her early career experiences range across print, broadcast, digital and radio, making her flexibility her biggest strength. 
                    She firmly believes that a nose for newsworthiness and the persistence that goes with being a reporter are transferable skills across continents.
