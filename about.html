                    <h2>
                    I was born and raised in Bangalore, in southern India before my work took me to New Delhi. I reported on finance policy for three years before moving to Chicago 
                    for a master's degree in investigative journalism at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. I'm interested in business-focused 
                    narrative journalism and longform investigations but I do not want to limit myself to it. During my program, I interned with the city desk at Chicago Sun-Times and trained 
                    with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's investigations team. 
                    </h2>

                    <h2>
                    Prior to my roles in Chicago, I was the New Delhi correspondent for an Indian broadcast channel - NDTV Profit, juggling video and web priorities for news from the Ministries of Finance, Commerce and Labor. 
                    My early career experiences range across print, broadcast, digital and radio, making my flexibility my biggest strength. 
                    I firmly believe that a nose for newsworthiness and the persistence that goes with it are transferable skills across continents.
