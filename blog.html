            <h2> Southern U.S. Witnessess Measleas Outbreak </h2>
            <h3> A new outbreak reignites vaccine efficacy debate; flu activity at 'high' levels in Chicago </h3>
            <p> An outbreak of measleas in the United States has thrown the spotlight on the spread of infectious diseases and the efficacy of vaccinations in combating it.
            The latest of which was the Health and Human Services Secretarey Robert F Kennedy Jr. who opined on consulting health-care providers and understanding 
            vaccine options in a piece on Fox News.
            
            <p>As of February 27, 2025, the <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"> Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> reported a total of 164 measles cases 
                were reported by nine jurisdictions across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
            </p>
            <p>With intermittent colder temperatures in the windy city, the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2025/feb/cdph-weekly-media-brief-02-28-2025.html"> Chicago Department of Public Health</a> 
            said in a weekly media brief on Feb 28, 2025
            that the activity level of overall acute respiratory illness remains moderate across Chicago. However flu activity remains 'high' although all influenza 
            surveillance indicators have decreased slightly from last week.</p> 
            <p> Health care providers continue to advise caution and advise citizens to update their vaccinations to better combact the spread.</p>

            <h2> Chi City Found Banned Lead Piping in 97.5% Of Home Inspections </h2>

            <h3> Public records show higher incidence of older piping in Austin, West Ridge</h3>
            <p> Water delivered by lead service lines continue to exisit in Chicago, almost 38 years after the federal decision to ban them came into force. 
            Service lines refer to the pipes that connect individual home connections to the city's main water line. Through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests,
            we found that 1219 homes out of 1249 homes inspected by the city had lead service lines between January 2023 until October 2024. In terms of the community areas with
            higher incidence of lead piping - Austin, West Ridge and South Lawndale stood out.

            <p>The mission to replace these pipelines are underway, albeit slowly. We found that of the many self-reported replacement programs, the city's newest program- Breaks&Leaks
                program accounted for the most number of replacements. With over 5010 replacements being made under the program between Jan. 2023 and Oct. 2024. The program
                debuted in Jan 2023, and was advertised as a 'free full lead service line replacement' whenever a leak or a break occured on a public lead service line.  
                Individuals can call the city's non-emergency helpline 311, and report a leak or break in the service line piping. This would then initiate the call to a city crew 
                to determine whether it is on public piping or private pipe-lines. Breaks or leaks on the public side are covered by the city.

            <h4> METHODOLOGY:</h4>
                <p>The data for visualizations were sourced from public records and requested from Chicago city's Department of Public Health and the Department 
                    of Water Management, respectively.
                    The original data was received in late Novemeber, 2024. It was then cleaned and formatted, before pivot tables were used to identify
                    patterns. The findings were vizualised on Flourish - an open access visualization tool. Updated community area maps were sourced from the 
                    Chicago data portal to plot area locations.
