            <h2> U.S. Witnessess Southern Measleas Outbreak </h2>
            <h3> A new outbreak, reignites vaccine efficacy debate</h3>
            <p> An outbreak of the Measleas in the United States has thrown the spotlight on the spread of infectious diseases and the efficacy of vaccinations in combating it.
            The latest of which was the Health and Human Services Secretarey Robert F Kennedy Jr. who opined on consulting health-care providers and understanding 
            vaccine options in a piece on Fox News. As of February 27, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported a total of 164 measles cases 
            were reported by 9 jurisdictions across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the current outbreak, is being observed in the South Plains region of Texas. 146 cases have been identified since late January,  
            of which twenty of the patients have been hospitalized. One fatality in a school-aged child was also recorded and the child was not vaccinated,
            according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.</p>
            <p> The outbreak has also sparked a renewed call-to-action from Kennedy. While the current spread has not reached Illinois. The confidence associated with combating the 
            disease is stronger with vaccinations. Here are a list of locations in the city of Chicago that offer vaccinations outside traditional hospitals.

            <p> Many Chicagoans get tap water delivered in lead service lines, which connect their homes to the main water line. Through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests,
            we found that 1219 homes out of 1249 homes inspected by the city had lead service lines between January 2023 until October 2024. In terms of the community areas with
            higher incidence of lead piping - Austin, West Ridge and South Lawndale stood out.
